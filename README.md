This repository showcases the projects I completed as part of my virtual internship with Oasis Infobyte in the field of Data Science. Each project reflects practical applications of Python, machine learning, and data analysis to solve real-world problems. Throughout this internship, I focused on various aspects of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling, culminating in solutions that demonstrate my skills in data science.

Task 1: Iris Flower Classification, aims to classify iris flowers into species based on their features such as petal and sepal dimensions. Using popular machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbors, I created a reliable model for classification. The dataset for this project is the well-known Iris dataset, readily available in Scikit-learn.

Task 2:  Unemployment Rate Analysis in India project focuses on analyzing unemployment trends across different regions of India over time. Through exploratory data analysis and visualization, I highlighted key insights and trends in unemployment rates, offering a comprehensive understanding of the data.

Task 3: In the Car Price Prediction project, I developed a predictive model to estimate the price of a car based on its attributes, such as engine size, horsepower, and brand. This project employed Linear Regression as the primary technique, demonstrating the effective use of machine learning for regression tasks. The dataset used for this task is included in the repository.

Task 4: The Email Spam Detection project focuses on classifying emails as spam or non-spam using Natural Language Processing (NLP). By leveraging TF-IDF vectorization and the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm, I built an efficient spam detector capable of distinguishing between genuine and junk emails. The dataset for this project contains labeled email samples and forms the foundation of the machine learning model.

Task 5: The Sales Prediction project addresses a common business problem of predicting sales based on advertising spend across various channels like TV, radio, and newspapers. Using Linear Regression, I analyzed the impact of advertising on sales and provided insights into which channels contributed the most. This project also includes data visualization to better understand the relationship between advertising and sales.
